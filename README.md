## About the project

Actually this is a project for learning node.io. And it's **done**.

From what I think, node.io is a nice library but not mature enough. I think node.io have these issues to improve:

* More flexible customize input method. Now you can only have a number count from 0 to input setting.
* Better document for sure.
* Better css selector. Best to use jquery.

And for now, use request.js to scrape is easier.
